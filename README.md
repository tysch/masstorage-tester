# masstorage-tester
Universal tool for speed measurement, long term data retention and endurance testing.
Fills target folder with a pseudorandom data, reads it back and check for read errors and silent data corruption.

# Caution! 
Raw device test will overwrite all data on target device with no option to recover, and this program is designed for versatility, not for fool-proof operation. Use at your own risk.

To compile, use 
$ make
